To Run:
I used clion ide to run the project with CMakeLists.txt file which can be found in the project files.

How To Play:
- There are 20 aliens and 5 levels. Each level has 4 aliens.
- First 3 level are filled with goog aliens (yellow), and last 2 levels filled with bad aliens(purple)
- You have 20 bombs to destroy the bad aliens.
- When your bombs ends or every bad alien destroyed game overs.
- Bombs created with left mouse click. Every second bomb drops to 1 lower level. You can tell bombs level by it's color.
- P: Pauses game
- S: When game paused, pressing s plays 1 frame and prints aliens locations.
- Q: Quits game.


Extras:
* When an alien dies, it do not just disappears. It fades to black as destroying animation.
* There are a limit of available bombs to drop(20). But these 20 bombs can be dropped one-by-one or simultaneously.
